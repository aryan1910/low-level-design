## Introduction

This repository contains low-level design examples and solutions to various real-world software design problems. The focus is on clear, maintainable, and efficient design patterns, object-oriented principles, and coding practices.

## Design Documents

Here youâ€™ll find various documents that provide detailed design explanations:

- **Design for ATM System**: A detailed low-level design of an ATM system, explaining each class and method.
- **Design for Online Banking System**: Low-level design of a banking application with a focus on transaction handling and security.
- **Design for File Compression System**: Low-level design of a file compression system that uses Huffman encoding.

## Code Examples

In this section, you'll find code implementations that correspond to the design documents above. Each example is written in different programming languages and reflects the respective design.

### Example Projects

- **ATM Design**: Implementation in Go using the State Design Pattern.
- **File Compression**: A basic implementation in Python using object-oriented principles.
- **Queue Management**: A real-world queue management system written in Java.

## Design Patterns

This repo also covers various design patterns that are helpful for creating scalable and maintainable systems:

- **State Pattern**
- **Singleton Pattern**
- **Factory Pattern**
- **Observer Pattern**
  
Each pattern is explained in detail with real-world use cases and implementations.
